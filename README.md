## Developing Locally

| Prerequisites                                                                |

1. Clone this repository, then run `npm install` in its root directory.

2. Recommended: link your local repository to a Netlify project. This will ensure you're using the same runtime version for both local development and your deployed project.

```sh
netlify link
